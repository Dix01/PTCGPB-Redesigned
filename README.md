A fork of [PTCGPB](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB) with a completely redesigned GUI and the added option to choose your own background.

## Overview

**PTCGPB-Redesigned** reimagines the original PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket Bot with major improvements in both aesthetics and customization. This version introduces a fresh, modern interface along with new features to enhance user experience.

**Latest Update: Auto Shutdown Runtime Feature**
This update introduces an Auto Shutdown Runtime capability:

## Runtime Limit Input: Users can now specify a runtime limit (in minutes) via the GUI.
## Automatic Shutdown: Once the specified duration elapses, the bot will automatically shut downâ€”preventing it from running indefinitely.
