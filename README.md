![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f45194f-9745-4b6f-b9ec-8758d3358590)

A fork of PTCGPB with a completely redesigned GUI and the added option to choose your own background.

Overview
PTCGPB-Redesigned reimagines the original PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket Bot with major improvements in both aesthetics and customization. This version introduces a fresh, modern interface along with new features to enhance user experience.

Key Enhancements
Completely Redesigned GUI:
Enjoy a modern, streamlined interface that improves usability and visual appeal.

Custom Background Option:
Personalize your experience by choosing your own background image directly within the application.

Latest Update: Auto Shutdown Runtime Feature
We are excited to announce a new update that introduces an Auto Shutdown Runtime feature:

Runtime Limit Input:
Users can now specify a runtime limit (in minutes) through the GUI.

Automatic Shutdown:
Once the set duration elapses, the bot will automatically shut down to prevent indefinite operation and optimize system resource usage.

This enhancement gives you greater control over the botâ€™s operation, ensuring it runs only as long as you need it to.

Features
Modern Interface:
A fresh layout that makes navigating the bot more intuitive.

Background Customization:
Easily set and change the background image to suit your personal style.

Preserved Core Functionality:
All original features of PTCGPB are maintained, ensuring you still get the full functionality you rely on.

Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Dix01/PTCGPB-Redesigned.git
License Change Notice
The original intention of this project was not for it to be used for paid services even those disguised as 'donations.'

In this release, we have updated the project's license. The previous GPL license has been replaced with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0).

What this means:

The project is now licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, which allows you to use, modify, and share the software only for non-commercial purposes.
Commercial use, including using the software to provide paid services or selling it (even if donations are involved), is not allowed under this license.
The new license applies to this and all future releases; unfortunately, previous versions remain under the GPL.
The bot will always be free and I will update it as long as this method is viable. I've spent many hours creating the PTCGPB, and if itâ€™s helped you complete your collection, consider buying me a coffee to keep me going and adding new features!
